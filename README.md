# Web-Development-in-Django

This repository contains complete project files (python, html, css, js) for several sites that I have developed over the course of my interenship.

Noteable implemetations:
- project 2: a website where you can put goods in your site, view, and order them with decent UI.
- project 4: a social media app with full user authentcation settings. You can post, comment and like posts.
- project 5: a simple chat app with groups and Pvs. This site uses websockets using django-channels
